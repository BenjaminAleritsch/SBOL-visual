## Prototypical Example

No Glyph Assigned is intended to be used for any chemical species whose type is not covered by other SBOL Visual glyphs.

## Notes
No Glyph Assigned is intended for molecular species with a defined specific type that happens to not yet be covered by available approved glyphs (other than the root). It is more likely to appear in machine-generated diagrams than in human-generated diagrams, since humans are likely to invent and use their own glyph for the purpose.
