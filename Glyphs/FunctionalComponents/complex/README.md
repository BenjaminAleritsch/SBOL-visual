## Recommended Glyph and Alternates
There are several proposed complex glyphs. One is to simply composite together other glyphs.  For example, a protein bound to a small molecule, a guide RNA, or another protein:

Another possibility is two connected circles, with or without a line between them:

Another alternative is the SBGN "cornered rectangle" glyph for a complex:
