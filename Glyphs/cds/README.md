## Recommended Glyph and Alternates
The coding sequence glyph is a "box" with one side bent out arrow-like to show direction:

![glyph specification](cds-specification.png)

Its recommended backbone alignment might either to the bottom or middle:

![glyph specification](cds-specification-middle.png)

A number of variants have been proposed; their alignment will match that of CDS except when otherwise noted. 

The block arrow and User Defined rectangle are already commonly used in diagrams:

Other alternatives include a chevron:

and asymmetric "halved" versions of the current CDS or block xarrow:
