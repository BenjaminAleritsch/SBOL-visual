The user defined component glyph is a plain rectangle, suggesting a blank slate to be written upon:

## Prototypical Example

User Defined Component is intended to be used for any Component that is not covered by other SBOL Visual symbols.

## Notes
User Defined has ambiguous vertical position, so its glyph does not yet have a recommended backbone alignment.
