# Cleavage Site

## Associated SO term(s)
SO:0001956 (Protease Site)

SO:0001977 (Ribonuclease Site)

SO:0000061, SO:0001687 (Restriction Site)

## Recommended Glyph and Alternates
The protease site glyph is an "X" denoting cleavage on top of a stem connecting to the backbone at the point where cleavage will occur:

The complementary Ribonuclease Site glyph is identical except that its stem is a dashed line rather than a solid line.

The complementary Restriction Site glyph is identical except that it has no "X" on top. Two possible recommended backbone alignments are under consideration.  Site centered on backbone:

Site on top of backbone:

## Prototypical Example

RNAse E site, BamHI
