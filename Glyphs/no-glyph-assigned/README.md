# No Glyph Assigned

## Associated SO term(s)
Any SO term that is not covered by any glyph besides the root Sequence Feature

## Recommended Glyph and Alternates

Currently, this is covered by the "User Defined" glyph, a plain rectangle suggesting a blank slate to be written upon:

![glyph specification](user-defined-specification.png)

A number of potential replacement glyphs have been proposed for covering No Glyph Assigned.  These are:

* A tall thin rectangle, which some fonts use as an alternative "replacement character":

  ![glyph specification](tall-rectangle-specification.png)

* A dashed line rectangle, implying something is missing:

## Prototypical Example

No Glyph Assigned is intended to be used for any Component that is not covered by other SBOL Visual glyphs.

## Notes
No Glyph Assigned is intended for constructs with a defined specific role that happens to not yet be covered by available approved glyphs (other than the root "Sequence Feature"). It is more likely to appear in machine-generated diagrams than in human-generated diagrams, since humans are likely to invent and use their own glyph for the purpose.
