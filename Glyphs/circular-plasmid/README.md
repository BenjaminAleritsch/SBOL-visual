## Associated SO term(s)

New term requested from Sequence Ontology


## Recommended Glyph and Alternates

The glyph to indicate embedding in a plasmid is a turn of the backbone indicating its circular structure:

## Prototypical Example

_E. coli_ p15A plasmid

## Notes

Complementary "left" and "right" versions of this glyph SHOULD be used together, flanking the region whose genomic context is being described.

The Omitted Detail glyph SHOULD generally be contatenated to indicate that there is information about the plasmid not being represented.

Example of RECOMMENDED usage:

SO:0000155 Plasmid covers both circular and linear plasmids, so a new more specific child term has been requested from SO. SO:0000155 may be used as a stopgap until the new term is added.
