# Composite

## Associated SO term(s)
Composite: SO:0000804 Engineered Region

## Recommended Glyph and Alternates

The RECOMMENDED glyph for Composite is dashed "expanding lines" connecting any "base" glyph representing the more abstract composite (e.g., Omitted Detail, or Terminator, or Promoter) to a backbone diagramming the contents of the composite. Note the bounding box is indicating the location of the base glyph, and would scale with that glyph.

For backward compatibility with the prior "User Defined" glyph, Composite can also be represented by a plain rectangle suggesting a blank slate to be written upon:

## Prototypical Example

An "expression cassette" containing a ribosome entry site, coding sequence, and terminator.


## Notes
An "abbreviated" representation of composite, simply indicating that more structure is available, can be made by using short lines and placing only an Omitted Detail glyph in the secondary backbone. For example, here is an example of an abbreviated composite promoter:
