## Recommended Glyph and Alternates
The terminator is a T sitting atop the backbone:

![glyph specification](terminator-specification.png)

A number of variants have been proposed.  Some add asymmetry by:

- Adding a "blocking" line handing down on the left:

- Cutting the terminator in half:

![glyph specification](terminator-specification-half.png)

- Or doing both:

Other variants make function more symbolic by:

- Looking somewhat like a stop sign (from the iGEM registry):

- Diagramming some sort of hairpin- or loop-like structure:
