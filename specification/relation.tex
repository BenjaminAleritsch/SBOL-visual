\nopagesection{Relation to other BBF RFCs and other Standards}

BBF RFC \rfcnum{} replaces BBF RFC 93 (SBOL Visual 1.0).

BBF RFC \rfcnum{} also implicitly supersedes the previously replaced BBF RFC 16 (a prior version of SBOL Visual, replaced by BBF RFC 93).

% Cannot, because 114  is not going to be out by the this spec is ready.

Every glyph in SBOL Visual 2.0 corresponds to an element of the SBOL 2.1 data model, as defined in BBF RFC 112.
BBF RFC \rfcnum{} also defines many terms by reference to BBF RFC 112, 
or by reference to the Sequence Ontology~\citep{SequenceOntology},
the Systems Biology Ontology~\citep{SBO},
or BioPAX~\citep{BioPAX}.


SBOL Visual is intended to be compatible with the Systems Biology Graphical Notation Activity Flow Language (SBGN AF)~\citep{sbgn}, 
and species and interaction glyphs have been imported from that language (see: \ref{apdx:sym:species} and \ref{apdx:sym:interaction}).
Some aspects are also imported from the Systems Biology Graphical Notation Process Description Language (SBGN PD).
