\section{SBOL Visual Diagram Language}
\label{sec:language}
% % -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An SBOL visual diagram represents a collection of \sbol{ModuleDefinition} and \sbol{ComponentDefinition} information.  
Each \sbol{ModuleDefinition} describes the functional relationships between a set of biological entities,
while each \sbol{ComponentDefinition} describes the structure of a biological entity.

\caption{Generic syntax of SBOL visual 2.0. A rectilinear boundary indicates a \sbol{ModuleDefinition} comprising some set of \sbol{FunctionalComponent} and \sbol{Interaction} instances.
A nucleic acid backbone indicates a \sbol{FunctionalComponent} whose \sbol{ComponentDefinition} is specified by the collection of attached nucleic acid \sbol{Component} icons.  
Strand can optionally be indicated by placing a \sbol{Component} above or below the backbone.  
Other \sbol{FunctionalComponent} instances are indicated by glyphs not in contact with any backbone.
\sbol{Interaction}s are directed edges connecting \sbol{Component} or \sbol{FunctionalComponent} instances of the appropriate type for the \sbol{Interaction}.  Undirected edges indicate \sbol{MapsTo} relationships between \sbol{Component} or \sbol{FunctionalComponent} instances (not shown).
Any of these objects may have an associated label showing its \sbol{name}, and the diagram may further include any form of other annotations, including other types of text.}

Specifically, an SBOL visual diagram consists of the classes of object illustrated in \ref{f:syntax}.
\ref{f:example} shows an example of such a diagram, in a typical usage.
Full details of this specification are provided in the remainder of this section.


\subsection{Nucleic Acid Backbone}
\label{s:lang:backbone}

A \sbol{FunctionalComponent} with a \sbol{type} designating it as a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, RNA) MAY be represented by a single or double line, representing the nucleic acid backbone. 
Information about the \sbol{ComponentDefinition} associated with that \sbol{FunctionalComponent} SHOULD be provided by attaching nucleic acid glyphs to the backbone, as defined below in \ref{s:lang:nacomponent}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Lines in some cases indicate strand count. 
	A double-stranded \sbol{Range} of the \sbol{ComponentDefinition} MAY use either a single or double line for the backbone.  
	A single-stranded \sbol{Range} of the \sbol{ComponentDefinition} MUST use a single line to indicate the backbone.
	When single and double lines are mixed within a single \sbol{ComponentDefinition}, the single lines always indicate single-stranded regions.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:1a}.

	\caption{Examples of indicating strand count in nucleic acid backbones}
	\label{exa:1a}
	\end{figure}
		
\item A nucleic acid backbone SHOULD be horizontal in orientation, 
	but MAY use non-horizontal structure to indicate important physical attributes 
	(e.g., a closed loop to indicate a cyclic plasmid or more complex shapes for DNA nanotech structures).   
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:1b}.

	\includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/examples/1b.pdf}
	\caption{Recommended, acceptable, and problematic examples of nucleic backbone orientation}
	\label{exa:1b}
	\end{figure}
	
\item A nucleic acid backbone SHOULD have at least one associated \sbol{Component} glyph (else no structural information is being provided).
	
\item Note: while inclusion of two \sbol{Component} instances on the same backbone can provide information about their relative locations (since both are part of the same \sbol{ComponentDefinition}), no relationship is specified between instances on different backbones.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Nucleic Acid Component}
\label{s:lang:nacomponent}

A glyph in contact with a nucleic acid backbone indicates a \sbol{Component} with a nucleic acid \sbol{type} that is contained within the \sbol{ComponentDefinition} associated with that nucleic acid backbone.
The \sbol{Component} may be contained either directly, as one of the \sbol{components} of the \sbol{ComponentDefinition} or recursively through a series of such containments.


\begin{enumerate}
\item Every nucleic acid \sbol{Component} glyph MUST have its bounding box contact the nucleic acid backbone associated with its (nth)-parent \sbol{ComponentDefinition}.  In general, it is RECOMMENDED that the symbol itself touch, and not just the bounding box, but for some symbols this may impede clarity.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:2a}.

	\centering

	\subfigure[MUST NOT]{\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/examples/2a-noncontact.pdf}}
	\caption{Examples of correct and incorrect association of glyphs with a nucleic acid backbone.}
	\label{exa:2a}
	\end{figure}
		
\item Any nucleic acid \sbol{Component} that is associated with a strand SHOULD be drawn
	with its vertical midpoint on the side of the backbone representing that strand.
	In a horizontal orientation the top SHOULD indicate the inline strand and the bottom
	SHOULD indicate the reverse complement strand.
	\todo[inline]{Consider allowing reverse by backwards symbol, then all SHOULD use same alignment indicator - bottom or backward}
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:2b}.

	\includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/examples/2b.pdf}
	\caption{Example of inline (+) and reverse complement (-) elements.}
	\label{exa:2b}
	\end{figure} 

\item Nucleic acid \sbol{Component}s in a sequential relationship SHOULD be drawn from 5' left to 3' right on the inline strand and from 5' right to 3' left on the reverse complement strand.

\item Nucleic acid components with \sbol{Locations} that do not overlap MUST NOT have glyphs whose bounding boxes overlap.
	An examples is provided in~\ref{exa:2d}.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/examples/2d.pdf}
	\caption{Example of incorrect glyph overlap: promoter (arrow) does not overlap in sequence with 5'UTR and CDS, so MUST NOT overlap visually with them.}
	\label{exa:2d}
	\end{figure}

\item Nucleic acid components with \sbol{Location}s that overlap SHOULD have glyphs whose bounding boxes overlap.  Overlap size MAY be used to indicate relative position.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:2e}.

	\subfigure[Restriction site in a CDS]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/2e-cutsite.pdf}}

	\caption{Examples where glyphs SHOULD overlap, but might not if it is more clear, e.g., with an operator site located within the 5' portion of a promoter}
	\label{exa:2e}
	\end{figure}

\item A nucleic acid \sbol{Component} SHOULD be represented using a glyph defined in \ref{apdx:sym:nacomponent}.  In this case, the glyph's definition MUST be equal to or a parent of at least one of the \sbol{roles} for the \sbol{Component} or its associated \sbol{ComponentDefinition}, and SHOULD be the RECOMMENDED variant of the most specific applicable glyph.  Note that novel glyphs not defined in \ref{apdx:sym:nacomponent} MAY be used, but SHOULD be proposed for adoption as described in \ref{sec:extension}.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:2f}.

	\subfigure[MAY]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/examples/2f-custom.pdf}}

	\label{exa:2f}
	\end{figure}
\end{enumerate}
	
	
\subsection{Labels}
The \sbol{name} of any object in a diagram is RECOMMENDED to be displayed as text within, adjacent to, or otherwise clearly visually connected to the object's associated glyph.  If no \sbol{name} is supplied, then the \sbol{displayId} MAY be used instead.
Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:5}.

	\caption{Examples of labels on glyphs.}
	\label{exa:5}
	\end{figure}


\subsection{Annotations}
Other text or graphics may be included as annotations with no constraint on their syntax or semantics.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Annotations SHOULD NOT be displayed in a way that allows them to be confused with other SBOL visual elements.
\item Annotations SHOULD NOT be used to display information that can be displayed using other SBOL visual elements.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Criteria for Compliance with SBOL Visual}

A diagram of a biological system is compliant with SBOL Visual if it complies with all MUST and MUST NOT requirements as specified above.
A diagram is compliant with SBOL Visual best practices if it also complies with all RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT statements as specified above.

Importantly, note that a non-SBOL glyph can be used in a compliant
diagram when its definition is a subset or superset of definition that
does have an SBOL Visual glyph.  For example, a diagram that creates a
new glyph for a special type of promoter can be SBOL Visual compliant
even though there is an SBOL Visual glyph for a general promoter.

A piece of software or other system for producing diagrams is
compliant with SBOL Visual under the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The system MUST be capable of producing diagrams that are
  compliant with SBOL Visual.
\item If the system can also produce diagrams that are {\em not}
  compliant with SBOL Visual, it MUST clearly distinguish to the user
  between compliant and non-compliant usage and diagrams.
\end{enumerate}
